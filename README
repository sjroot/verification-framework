This project is used to generate the test data for both the C++ and Java tests.

In order to build, ant is required.  Use the following command to build and generate test data:

ant

The result of the build will be contained in the newly created out directory.  This directory will contain a JAR of the compiled code, a operations.dat (list of operations to be performed), and testdata.dat (the data to perform the operations on).

There are several parameters that can be changed in order to generate different data sets.  They are as follows:

max - The maximum number of data elements to be created
operations - The maximum number of operations to be created
depth - The maximum number of levels deep that data should be 
branches - The maximum number of branches should be created per node

In order to supply these paramters to ant, use the following syntax:

ant -Dmax=<...> -Doperations=<...> -Ddepth=<...> -Dbranches=<...>

If values are not supplied, the following defaults will be used:

max - 100
operations - 10
depth - 5
branches - 5
